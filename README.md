# DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Monitor with Python GUI

This project involves interfacing a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with an Arduino to read temperature and humidity values, and display them on a Python dashboard in real-time.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to:

- Interface a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with an Arduino.
- Read the sensor data and send it to a Python application via serial communication.
- Display the temperature and humidity data on a graphical user interface (GUI) in real-time using the Python Tkinter library.

### Features:

- **Arduino Code**: Collects temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor and sends it via Serial to a Python program.
- **Python GUI**: Displays the real-time temperature and humidity data in an easy-to-read format.

## Hardware Requirements

1. **Arduino Uno** (or any compatible Arduino board)
2. **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **USB Cable** for Arduino connection to PC

### DHT11 Sensor Pinout:

- **VCC**: 5V or 3.3V (depending on your Arduino board)
- **GND**: Ground
- **Data Pin**: Pin 2 (or any other digital I/O pin of your choice)

## Software Requirements

1. **Arduino IDE**: For writing and uploading code to the Arduino.
2. **Python 3.x**: For running the GUI application.
3. **Python Libraries**:
    - `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.
    - `pyserial`: For serial communication between Arduino and Python.

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Arduino Setup

1. **Connect the DHT11 sensor** to the Arduino as follows:
    - **VCC** to 5V
    - **GND** to Ground
    - **Data Pin** to Pin 2 (or your preferred pin)

2. **Upload the Arduino Code**:
    - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the following code:

    ```cpp
    #include <DHT.h>

    #define DHTPIN 2      // Pin where the DHT22 is connected
    #define DHTTYPE DHT22 // Define the sensor type as DHT22
    
    DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);
    
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);
      dht.begin();
    }
    
    void loop() {
      float temperature = dht.readTemperature(); // Read temperature in Celsius
      float humidity = dht.readHumidity();       // Read humidity
    
      if (isnan(temperature) || isnan(humidity)) {
        Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
      } else {
        Serial.print("Temperature: ");
        Serial.print(temperature);
        Serial.println(" Â°C");
    
        Serial.print("Humidity: ");
        Serial.print(humidity);
        Serial.println(" %");
      }
      
      delay(2000); // Delay for 2 seconds
    }

    ```

3. **Upload the code** to your Arduino board.

### 2. Python Setup

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
    - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    - Install the required libraries by running the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install pyserial tkinter
    ```

2. **Run the Python GUI Application**:
    - Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
    - Navigate to the project directory.

## How the Python GUI Works

- The GUI is built using **Tkinter** and displays the temperature and humidity data in real-time.
- The `pyserial` library is used to read the serial data from the Arduino.
- Every 2 seconds, the Python GUI is updated with new readings from the Arduino.
- The temperature value is displayed in **green**, and the humidity value is displayed in **blue** for easy distinction.

---

## Expected Results

- **Arduino Code**: Reads the temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor and prints it to the Serial Monitor.
- **Python GUI**: Displays the real-time data from the sensor and updates it every 2 seconds.
